# Pearson vs Spearman Correlation

Correlation is a statistic that measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other.
One of the commonly used correlation measures is Pearson correlation coefficient. Another commonly used correlation measure is Spearman correlation coefficient.
Pearson correlation quantifies the linear relationship between two variables, while Spearman correlation is also known as Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation as it computes correlation coefficient on rank values of the data.
I compared Pearson correlation and Spearman correlation, then demonstrated the differences with a data analysis example in Python.
